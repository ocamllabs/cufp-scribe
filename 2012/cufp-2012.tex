\section{Overview}

Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is a yearly workshop
that is aimed at the community of software developers who use functional
programming in real-world settings.  This scribe report covers the talks
that were delivered at the 2012 workshop, which was held in association
with ICFP in Copenhagen.  The goal of the report is to give the reader
a sense of what went on, rather than to reproduce the full details
of the talks.  Videos and slides from all the talks are available online at \url{http://cufp.org}.
