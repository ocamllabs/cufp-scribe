\section{Overview}

Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is a yearly workshop
that is aimed at the community of software developers who use functional
programming in real-world settings.  This scribe report covers the talks
that were delivered at the 2012 workshop, which was held in association
with ICFP in Copenhagen.  The goal of the report is to give the reader
a sense of what went on, rather than to reproduce the full details
of the talks.  Videos and slides from all the talks are available online at \url{http://cufp.org}.

\section{Keynote: Adopting Functional Programming}

\section{Jane Street Status Report}

% A Caml's Progress
% 
% Jane Street is mired in FP, but not in transitional environment; not
% academic, not theorem proving, etc.
% 
% This talk is an update on where they are on using OCaml after more
% than a decade.
% 
% --
% 
% The Jane Street company interacts with lots of people, anonymously,
% over the world's securities markets.  They have 320 employees in three
% continents, with billions of dollars per day traded; much more than
% the value of the company.  In this situation, it is easy to go out of
% business is a mistake is made.
% 
% There is a lot of exogenous complexity in their environment:
% regulation, new security types, many other actors to interact with,
% etc.
% 
% Their software has three main kinds of requirements:
% 
% * Correctness - most important, related to the "easy to go out of
% business" point above
% 
% * Agility - need to quickly exploit new opportunities as they're found
% 
% * Performance - of course
% 
% --
% 
% Application areas where Jane St. has written OCaml code:
% 
% * Research Tools - investigating trading strategies with statistics; prediction
% 
% * Trading Systems - was VB in Excel.  used to make trades automatically
% 
% * Order Gateways - programs that interact with markets, talking
%  others' protocols, having to deal with differences between the
%  specification and reality.
% 
% * Post-Trade - internal understanding of completed trades, cleanup
%  related to closing houses
% 
% * Systems Infrastructure - management of systems; IT
% 
% * Dev Tools - 100 devs (including part time); OCaml is a good language
%  but has bad tools
% 
% * Trading Tools - visualization using curses; prevent bad UX designers
%  from doing UX
% 
% * Market Data - pull data from exchanges around the world
% 
% * Desk Infrastructure - trading desks' tools build (by traders) in
%  OCaml; one month training in OCaml for new traders
% 
% --
% 
% Platform:
% 
% * Core - stdlib replacement
% 
% * Async - sort-of-threads; it is okay to have different abstractions
%  for different things
% 
% * Incremental - large scale computations w/ small updates
% 
% * Catalog - pub/sub system w/ high level architecture abstractions
% 
% * Nile - distributed message passing (in progress)
% 
% --
% 
% Future:
% 
% * More OCaml - committed fully
% 
% * More Open Source - improve community by contributing code back to it
% 
% * More Collaboration - improve core technology, tools
% 
% ==
% 
% Q: What is your experience with the usual pattern of increased
% rigidity/obscurity with large systems?
% 
% A: 1) Can refactor ruthlessly because of strong typing
%   2) avoid clever tricks, as/when they are hard to explain to others
% 
% Q: FP is usually described as 10x more concise than imperative, in
% your experience, is it 9x?  11x?
% 
% A: don't want concision first, want explicitness.  Don't have a real #
% on rewrites from other code to OCaml because of adding features.
% 
% Q: What failures happen often?
% 
% A: Jane St. code fails by turning off; this happens, but it's okay.
% Failure causes are usual problems, load, incorrect
% specification/understanding of world, etc.

\section{Conclusion}

We would like to thank Simon Thompson and Duncan Coutts for helping to
organize the CUFP tutorials, and Ashish Agarwal for organizing the BoF
sessions.  Also, we thank Peter Thiemann and Fritz Henglein and the
whole ICFP/CUFP team for their assistance in Copenhagen.  We look
forward to CUFP 2013 in Boston!
