Notes on "CUFP 2012 Workshop Report" 

In general, I really enjoyed reading this report. If I had read it before
ICFP in Boston, I might have attended CUFP despite my serious time
constraints. The following notes are minor editorial suggestions. 

Five global issues come up repeatedly: 

1. Type-setting an apposition with dashes requires an m-dash (3x "-") that
touches the bordering words. For example, "... a criticism---in the sense
of these notes---is a suggestion on how to present ..." is the right way to
type-set m-dashes. 

2. Your use of colon (":") is highly Germanic. According to Strunk and
White (the American bible) a colon primarily introduces enumerations; on
rare occasions you use it for a single point (an enumeration of one). Many,
though not all, of your uses justify the main clause with a colon clause. 

3. Also avoid putting remarks in parentheses. Integrate the phrases into
the sentences or use footnotes instead. 

4. Your section headings should use a consistent capitalization rule. 

5. Type-set footnotes to the right of punctuation, e.g.,
 ".. words,\footnote{hello} ... "

The rest are page by page enumerations of issues: 

page 1:
------

abstract, line 1: "yearly" => "annual" 
para 2, line 2: "(taking cues ...)" => "Taking cues from anthropology,
 Thorup described ..." 
para 3, line -2: "their" => "his/her" 
para 4: dashes 

page 2: 
------

para 2, line 1: "series" => "serious" (possibly something else)
description environment: 
 "Performance" change to "The software needs to run fast ..." (or something
 else missing?) 
para -3, line 2: "(replacing ...)" => "replacing legacy systems implemented
 in VBA/Excel" 
para -2, line 1: does "happen during production" mean "was discovered after
 deployment"? I cannot believe that they didn't discover any bugs during
 the production of the code 

page 3: 
-------

para 1, line 2: check spelling of Caroun 
para 2, line 2: "meant to" => "meant to supplement" (?) 
para 5, line 2: cut "only" 
para -1, line 1: "Grgens" => "GÃ¶rgens" 
 ** throughout section 5"

page 4: 
-------

para 1, line 1: "communicate" (spelling)
para 1, line 6: consider expanding "loc" (once)
para -1, line -1: re-arrange to "also cited as notable problem the lack of
 visual tools to talk about a system's architecture." 

page 5: 
-------

para 2, line -3: "based on a ``on pattern do something'' construct" =>
 "based on an ``on pattern do something'' construct"  
para 3, line 2: ":" => ";" 
para 4, line 1: "... design and it ..." => "... design, and it ..." 
para 4, line 2: spell out "fab" 
para 4, line -1: cut "the software ... obsolete." (This adds no
 information.) 
para 5, line 2: "but also to build .. in teams." I do not understand this
 phrase at all. 
para 6, line 3: "extensibility" (spelling) 
para 7, line 2: ":" => "." 
footnote: "Star is available from the author on request via ..." 

page 6: 
-------

section 8, para 1: a four-line sentence, drags on, nearly incomprehensible 
 AA reported on the Genomics Sequencing Core project, jointly run by ... It
 is used to ..." might work. 
section 8, para 2: consider "getting faster at high rates" => "getting
 faster quickly" 
section 8, para 3, line -1: "systems" => "system"
section 8, para 4: this paragraph may need expansion, consider
 "distinguishes between original and derived data, re-computing the latter
 on the fly" 
para -2, line 3: "``1.3 developers''" is extremely awkward. How about "A
 full-time developer with a part-time assistant ..." or "1/3-time
 assistant" 

page 7: 
-------

para 4, line 2: ":" => ". In particular, " 
para 4, line 3: "networks" => "network" 
para 4, line 4: should this be "systems biologists" (extra "s")
para 4, line 5: "from those computer scientists" -> missing words  
para 6, line 2: ":" => "." 
para 7, line -1: "Methilician S- A-, commonly known as MRSA, which causes
 ..." 

[[ We both disagree with the presenter concerning the content of the last
paragraph on the capabilities of Emacs. Perhaps a footnote is in order. ]]

page 8: 
-------

para 1, line 1: "the the" => "the" 
para 1, line 3: ":" => ". Hence, " 
para 1, line 4: should this be "WebSockets" 
para 3, line 5: "messages.^3." => "messages.^3" 
para -3, line -1: should this be "370,000loc" or "37,000loc"

page 9: 
-------

para 1, line 3: "Java ecossystem" => either "Java's ecosystem" or "the Java
  ecosystem" (also note extra "s")
para 3, line 2: possibly expand "VC"
para 4, line 2: "(TSO ... itself)" => should expand into a footnote 
para 4, line 5: "electricity" (spelling)

 immutable"
para -1, line 1: second occurrence of "state" replace with "that"

cut last sentence because it's too late for that one
