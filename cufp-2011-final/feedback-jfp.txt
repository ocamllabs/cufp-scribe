Hi Anil (/ Yaron / Marius),

Many thanks for taking the trouble to write this up.  Mathhias, Xavier, and I have all looked over it and we think it's great.  (We made a few comments for your consideration while preparing the final copy, which you'll find in the "referee reports.")  

Best,

   - Benjamin

Comments to the Author
Lovely write-up of what sounds like an excellent meeting.  Just a few tiny comments:

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

page 1: 

title: Instead of "Scribe report," what about "Workshop report"? The former
sounds a bit less formal and polished, which doesn't do justice to the
quality of the write-up!

affiliations: the commas at the end of Yaron's and Marius's names look ugly 
[I hope this isn't our style sheet]

overview: 

line 3: "delivered in" should probably be "delivered at" 

line -2: I would cut "rough" 

section 2: 

line 4: please replace "Lennart" with "Augustsson" (reduce informality a bit)

line -8: "concepts which" should be "concepts that" 

line -6: change "Lennart brought ... over" to "Augustsson applied ... to" 

line -5: Q: aren't pH's MVars just a reimplementation of id's M-structures? 

line -3: "design, and is still" : delete ","

line -2: How about rephrasing the last sentence as "Interestingly,
Bluescript's type system incorporates numbers and arithmetic." 

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page 2: 

line 1: "Lennart" => "Augustsson"
line 2: "quants" => "quantitative analysts"
   (let's write this in a professional manner)
line 3: see "quants", change end of line to "transformation and do" (?)
line 5: "lazyness" = "laziness", replace "by being" with "and is" 
   plus "instead" at end of sentence 
line 8: "(and only 6% of their modules turn this on)" => "and only 6% of their
modules make use of it." 
line 15: see "quants" 
penultimate paragraph [2]: "Lennart" => "Augustsson" 
last paragraph: even though Lennart may have made this statement about hardware
designers with the bad implication about quants, I think we should drop the
quote from your written report. Imagine the following line in a journal on
financial analysis "We had to invent a safe programming language because the
best PL techies could come up with is C++, and even an economist could do
better." 

line 5[3]: "sequentialization comes from" => "sequentiality constraints are due to"
line -3: "was done by" => "proceeded via" 

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page 3: 

line 8[4]: "This scheduler" => "Its scheduler" 
line 11: I would remove the quotes around "Whooper"
line -1: "making such an" => "with its" 

line 1 [5]: "The next talk by Thomas Arts" -- missing verb 
line 2: "devoted to doing" => "devoted to" 
line 5: (“the brakes might need to know how fast the car is going!”)
   => "For example, ``the brakes might need to know how fast the car is going.''"
line -5: "parameterized on" => "parametrized on"
line -3: "the the" 

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page 4: 

line 4: "like this: customers" => "like this. Customers" 
line 8: "educate their" => "educates its" 
line 10: "Keigo" -> "Imai" 
line -9[6]: delete "bound using" 
line -3: "output (to quote Keigo, ”it is written in our miraculous super OCaml technique!”)
   => "``output. To quote Keigo, ``it is written in our miraculous super OCaml technique.''"
line -2: "from" => "of" and delete the parentheses 

line 4[7]: "the preferred" => "their preferred"
line 6: "code in Java directly" => "Java"

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page 5: 

line 1: "when developing the high-volume..." -- delete "the"? 
line 6: "use of implicits are..." => "is" 

line -1[8]: replace ":" with "." 

line 7: "increased, and is" => "increased and is"
line -6: delete "of this"
   replace "used to go to" with "for" (though I am not sure on this one)
line -5: delete "," in "simulated, and"
line -2: replace "vodoo" with "tricks"  and cut comma 

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page 6: 

line 4: "core ideas" => "principles" 
line 5: "lazyness" => "laziness"

line 3[10]: "very complex" => "difficult" 
line 8: "(i.e." => ", i.e."
line 9: cut ")"
line -2: cut "but is not mandatory"

section 11: other than in the title, the section does not mention or cite
mzScheme. It is my understand that Naughty Dog binds mzScheme version 3.5.
(The C++ level of Mz helps you program as if you were in Scheme, using C++
syntax.) If so, I suggest adding a sentence to that effect. MzScheme is now
called Racket and the proper URL is racket-lang.org. 

line -6: cut "oodles of" 
last line: this is where you may wish to change the prose slightly so that it
doesn't sound like they are the 73rd group to implement a Scheme interpreter 
(yes there are about 72 actively maintained Scheme implementations, though 
only a handful of large ones). 

;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
page 7: 

line 2 [12]: "two halves: a management and storage stack" -- reads funny;
maybe ""two halves: a management stack and a storage stack" 

line 5[12]: delete "very" 
line -6: ", and deal" -> "and deal"
line -3: "such as the Lwt threading library and Bitstring syntax extension, and
increasing the number of I/O threads used." should be "such as the Lwt
threading library, the Bitstring syntax extension, and increasing the number of
I/O threads used." but I'm not sure 
line -2: "Tom" -> "Wilkie"
